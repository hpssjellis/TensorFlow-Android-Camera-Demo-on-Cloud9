# TensorFlow-Android-Camera-Demo-on-Cloud9
TensorFlow Android Camera Demo loaded onto Cloud9 for ease of use


Jan 8th. The final workspace may work but is too big for a free account with cloud9 so I am working on learning Docker so that the Android SDK can be pre-installed.

Would be great to have a cloud9 account with pre-installed Android SDK
