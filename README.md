Have been waiting for Cloud9 to make an Android-sdk template, but it seems to be going slowly. Thought I would try to slim things down so that everything can fit on the Cloud9 site.

Jan 8th. The final workspace may work but is too big for a free account with cloud9 so I am working on learning Docker so that the Android SDK can be pre-installed.

Would be great to have a cloud9 account with pre-installed Android SDK
